# 🛰️ Sovereign Ops

Sovereign Ops is a technical framework designed to bridge the gap between **Agentic Intelligence** and **Production SaaS**. This repository serves as the foundation for the 2026 Sovereign Growth Protocol.

## 🚀 Strategic Value
* **MCP Integration**: Standardizing Model Context Protocol bridges for AI-to-hardware communication.
* **AEO-Native**: Optimized for Answer Engine discovery via structured metadata.
* **Proof of Work**: Demonstrating immutable reasoning logs and secure infrastructure patterns.

## 🛠️ Architecture
- `/src/mcp`: Agentic interface definitions.
- `/docs/strategy`: Whitepapers for VC and Founder alignment.
- `/schemas`: Governance and truth ledger definitions.

## 📈 Roadmap
- [ ] Initialize MCP Server Boilerplate
- [ ] Deploy AEO Discovery Layer (`llms.txt`)
- [ ] Integrate Multi-Agent Orchestration Logic

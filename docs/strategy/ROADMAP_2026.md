# Strategic Roadmap: Sovereign Agentic Infrastructure

## 🎯 Objective
To engineer a modular, AEO-optimized bridge that enables autonomous SaaS operations through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
* **Local Ingress**: Established secure Stdio transport for local environment interaction.
* **AEO Indexing**: Implemented `llms.txt` standards for native AI discovery.
* **Type Safety**: Enforced TypeScript/NodeNext standards for production-grade reliability.

## 🛰️ Phase 2: Agentic Orchestration (Q1-Q2 2026)
* **Tool Expansion**: Integrating external API connectors (Stripe, GitHub, PostHog) via MCP.
* **Reasoning Logs**: Implementing immutable audit trails for agent-driven actions.
* **Multi-Agent Bridges**: Allowing specialized agents to hand off tasks through this central bridge.

## 💰 Phase 3: Sovereign SaaS (Q3-Q4 2026)
* **Headless Operations**: Full decoupling of the UI, allowing the business to run as a "Service of Agents."
* **Market Capital**: Transitioning the framework into a proprietary moat for sovereign growth partnerships.
